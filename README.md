## Ignition Hacks 2022 Team UTS 1


The following project uses LSTM and RNN to predict future EEG signals based on "EEG Dataset Recorded In A Car Simulator". 

Specifically, an architecture of stacked LSTM with a Dense Layer is used. 

Results including accuracy and loss statistics are interpreted using the Python library Tensorflow. 

Participants in the hackathon: Alam Chinna, John Hu, Richard Bai.
